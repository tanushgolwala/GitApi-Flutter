# GitHub Repository Viewer

GitHub Repository Viewer is a Flutter application that allows users to view repositories of a specified owner on GitHub and see their commit history.

## Features

- Input field to enter the owner's name
- Displays a list of repositories for the specified owner
- Shows commit history for each repository

## Note

THIS IS A BARE MINIMUM IMPLEMENTATION OF HOW TO COMSUME THE GITHUB API WITHIN FLUTTER AND FURTHER EXPLORE ITS APPLICATIONS.

THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN MADE JUST AS AN EXAMPLE
KINDLY REFER TO 'repoapi.dart' FOR THE RIGHT PRACTICES TO BE FOLLOWED DURING FUTURE API INTEGRATIONS
